As this is my first project on github and also my second overall project there will be alot of stuff thats a mess.
The usage of this bot is simple, You can use the !sresin command to as its name suggests to set the amount of resin you have
Then depending on your game you can either type !genshin
Then you will get the amount of time left until your resin is capped or if it is capped you will be told so right there.
When i was making this bot i had no prior information about the feature with hoyolab that allows you to know when your resin is capped thus i made this bot
So if your encountering alot of issues or you have no desire to use such a bot i recommend you install hoyolab and use the feature there.
At the time of making this bot there was no API for genshin as thus i could only make a manual input for resin
I dont know if i will return to improve this project but if you have any desire to improve/got an idea to make this project better then please feel free to do so
